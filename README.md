## Features

- **Edge AI Runtime**: Lightweight runtime for deploying and running AI models on various edge devices.
- **Model Management**: Version control and easy deployment mechanisms for AI models.
- **Federated Learning Support**: Train models across distributed edge devices with privacy-preserving mechanisms.
- **Edge-Cloud Hybrid Processing**: Seamlessly offload complex computations to the cloud.
- **Device Management**: Central dashboard for monitoring and managing edge devices.
- **Data Pipeline**: Efficient data collection, preprocessing, and synchronization between edge and cloud.
- **Security Features**: End-to-end encryption and secure model deployment.
- **API and SDK**: Well-documented API and SDKs for major programming languages.
- **Extensibility**: Plugin system for custom modules and integrations.

## Architecture

EdgeAIForge is built with a modular architecture, consisting of the following main components:

1. **Edge Runtime**: Runs on edge devices, manages local model execution and data processing.
2. **Cloud Services**: Handles complex computations, stores aggregated data, and manages models.
3. **Platform Core**: Coordinates between edge devices and cloud services, manages API requests, and orchestrates federated learning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.55.0 or later
- Cargo package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/doziestar/edgeaiforge.git
   cd edgeaiforge
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. Run tests to ensure everything is set up correctly:
   ```
   cargo test
   ```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use EdgeAIForge to deploy a model to an edge device:

```rust
use edgeaiforge::edge_runtime::EdgeRuntime;
use edgeaiforge::model_management::Model;

fn main() {
    // Initialize the edge runtime
    let mut runtime = EdgeRuntime::new();

    // Load a model
    let model = Model::load("path/to/model.onnx").unwrap();

    // Deploy the model to the edge runtime
    runtime.deploy_model(model).unwrap();

    // Run inference
    let input = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0];
    let output = runtime.run_inference(&input).unwrap();

    println!("Inference output: {:?}", output);
}
```
